🔹 Step 1: Set Up Your Files
Create a folder for your project and inside it, create:

An HTML file (for structure)

A CSS file (for styling)

A JavaScript file (for logic)

Connect the CSS and JavaScript files to your HTML.

🔹 Step 2: Build the Layout (HTML)
Use HTML to create:

A heading (e.g. "My To-Do List")

An input box where users can type a task

A button that says “Add Task”

An empty area (like a list) where tasks will appear

🔹 Step 3: Add Style (CSS)
Style your page to make it look clean and user-friendly:

Center your content on the page

Add spacing, borders, and colors

Style the input box and buttons to make them look nice

Add hover effects if you want a modern feel

🔹 Step 4: Add Interactivity (JavaScript)
Use JavaScript to:

Detect when the user clicks the “Add” button
→ Grab the text from the input box.

Create a new list item
→ Show the task in the list area on the page.

Clear the input box
→ After adding a task, make sure the box is empty again.

Mark tasks as completed
→ When a user clicks a task, add a visual change (like strike-through or gray color).

Delete a task
→ Add a small button next to each task to remove it from the list.

🔹 Step 5: Test and Improve
Try entering different tasks

Try deleting and marking tasks as complete

Adjust your styling or logic if something feels off

write an id variable to delete a task based on id
